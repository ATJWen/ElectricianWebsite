				<h2>Who we are</h2>
				<p class="longtext">D-Lectronics unofficialy begun in 2003, when co-founders Daragh and Darragh met in their late university days as housemates. With a passion for electronics, they started a project helping to repair electrical appliances ranging from landline telephones to refrigerators to earn some money on the side. After graduating with a Masters from Sheffield Hallam University, Daragh and Darragh officially launched D-lectronics.</p>

					<p class="rating review reviewfloat">9/10 -Emma FItzgerald</p>
					<p class="review reviewfloat">It was a complicated job from the front of the house to the back because there was no crawl space or attic to hide the wiring, yet Daragh managed to do the installation perfectly</p>

					<p class="rating review">7/10 -Ian O'Regan</p>
					<p class="review">Darragh was really understanding when we had a misunderstanding over who paid him, and he had make a follow up call asking for payment. 
					We know he's very busy because a good electrician is hard to find in this area, so we appreciate the neighborly personal touch.
					As long distance landlords we are happy we finally found a reliable electrician with great communication skills.</p>
